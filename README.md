## Note: 
This fork is probably only necessary, if you want to install React-Navigation on non-Unix/Mac based systems, standalone and test the examples on devices/simulators. Usually the library is included via imports into main apps, which seems to cause no problems on other OS's.

The branch 'stevieBranch' will be frequently updated/merged.
